# README: Evaluation of Reproducibility Artifacts

## Artifact Identification

**Report Title**: Machine Learning Model Evaluation for Predictive Analysis  
**Group Number**: 5  
**Students**:  
- Alice Smith, ID: 1234567  
- Bob Johnson, ID: 8901234  

**Abstract**:  
This project develops and evaluates a machine learning model for predictive analysis using synthetic datasets. The main contribution is a reproducible pipeline for training and validating the model, demonstrating its accuracy and scalability. The artifact includes Python scripts, a synthetic dataset generator, and configuration files, enabling full reproducibility of the experiments reported. The software architecture follows a modular design with a data preprocessing module, a model training module, and a result visualization module. The artifact ensures reproducibility by providing all necessary code and data to regenerate the accuracy metrics and graphs presented in the report.

## Artifact Dependencies and Requirements

- **Hardware Resources**:  
  - Minimum: 4-core CPU, 8GB RAM, 20GB storage  
  - Recommended: 8-core CPU, 16GB RAM for faster execution  

- **Operating Systems**:  
  - Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS; compatible with Windows 10/11 and macOS 12+  

- **Software Libraries**:  
  - Python 3.9  
  - NumPy 1.21  
  - Pandas 1.4  
  - Matplotlib 3.5 (for result visualization)  
  - scikit-learn 1.0  

- **Input Dataset**:  
  - A synthetic dataset generated by `generate_data.py` (included in the artifact).  
  - Size: ~500MB when generated; no external data download required.  

- **Other Dependencies**:  
  - None; all requirements are self-contained to minimize setup complexity.

## Artifact Installation and Deployment Process

### Installation and Compilation
1. Ensure Python 3.9 is installed (`python3 --version` to verify).  
2. Clone the repository or unzip the artifact package.  
3. Navigate to the root directory:  
   ```bash
   cd artifact_directory
